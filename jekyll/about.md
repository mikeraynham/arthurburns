<h4>Helping to build the future with materials from the past</h4>

Arthur Burns & Son of Over Alderley supply bricks, flags, setts and other building materials for a variety of projects and conservation areas throughout the country.

Continuing in the family tradition, Arthur Burns & Son is now owned and run by David Burns.  The firm's paperwork and much of its day to day running is handled by David's wife, Stella.  Their home, Woodend, is situated adjacent to the company's yard, which is always brimming with reclaimed building materials, destined for distribution throughout the country.

Over the years, Arthur Burns & Son have supplied materials for a wide variety of projects, including:

Originating over a century ago, Burns Bros operated a horse and cart haulage business which travelled as far as Buxton.  The main task of the day was the supply of coal to the local area from their centre of operations at Alderley Edge railway goods yard.

During the Second World War, the family ran an agricultural contracting business which ploughed, sowed and harvested areas of land which had been bought for development before 1939.

When the coal industry was nationalised the three Burns brothers decided to split their business interests.  George, the elder, continued in the coal business, while Horace and Arthur went into general haulage.

The break up of the firm after the war coincided with the cleaning up of bombed out Manchester and needless to say, there was a shortage of good seasoned timber.  Arthur Burns saw the possibility of combining the old with the new and his ideas interested several large local builders.

Two of these builders, L. Brown & Son of Wilmslow and Isaac Massey & Son of Alderley Edge, lent their support; and from this Arthur Burns & Son began their business, which is still flourishing today.
